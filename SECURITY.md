# Security Policy

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers by opening a confidential issue in the main Vanopticon repository or emailing <security@vanopticon.local> (replace with appropriate contact). Do not create a public issue for vulnerabilities.

Guidelines:

- Provide steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any proof-of-concept or exploit code.
- Include recommended mitigations if known.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 3 business days and provide updates on remediation.
