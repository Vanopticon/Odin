# Agent progress — 2025-11-27 12:00 UTC

Actions performed by automated agent:

- Read and verified Obsidian LTM keys: `project_brief`, `active_context`, `system_patterns`, `tech_stack`, `progress_tracker`.
- Created an in-repo progress note and appended a timestamped update to `Engineering/progress_tracker.md` in the Obsidian vault.
- Created and updated the agent-managed todo list for this session; initial tasks completed and next steps recorded.

Context:

- Repository: `Vanopticon/Odin`
- Working branch: `feature/architect-plan-20251127` (current workspace branch)

Next steps:

1. Optionally run `pnpm test` and `pnpm lint` locally and append results to `Engineering/progress_tracker.md`.
2. Implement the chosen small change from the plan (unit test, minor lint fix, or other small task).
3. Open a PR linking this work once tests and lint pass.

This file was added by the agent to capture a local copy of progress for visibility in the repository.
