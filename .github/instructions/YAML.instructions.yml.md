# YAML (.yml) Companion

Purpose: This companion file covers the `.yml` extension. All rules are the same as `YAML.instructions.md` (which targets `*.yaml`). When making changes to `.yml` files, follow the directives in `YAML.instructions.md`.

## Exception Handling & Human Review

- **Include a note in the summary for Human Review**: If changes would violate these directives, the agent must use the method that conforms closest to the directives and include a note in the summary for human review.
