# Agent Directives — JSON Formatting & Linting

Purpose: These directives are written for an automated coding agent that creates or modifies JSON files in this repository. The repository's Prettier config (`.prettierrc.json`) is definitive for formatting; these directives cover content, validation, and conventions not enforced by Prettier.

## Formatting & Content Rules

- **Include `$schema` when available**: If a JSON Schema exists for the file being edited or created, include the `$schema` property as the first key in the file with the appropriate URL. If no specific schema is known, prefer widely used schemastore URLs (e.g., `https://json.schemastore.org/prettierrc` for Prettier config).
- **Validate against schema (best-effort)**: When `$schema` is present or a known schema exists for a filename (e.g., `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.markdownlint.json`) attempt to validate the JSON against that schema. Validation is best-effort: do not block or fail a proposed change solely because validation could not be performed (for example, if the schema is unreachable or private). Annotate the summary with the validation outcome if not successful:
  - Inaccessible: The schema was not accessible and therefore the agent was unable to perform validation.
  - Issues: note validation errors and the specific issues found.
- **No comments**: Do not add JavaScript-style comments to `.json` files. JSON must be valid JSON. Do not use `jsonc` or `jsonb`.
- **Double quotes only**: Use double quotes for all keys and string values (JSON standard). Do not use single quotes.
- **Correct primitive types**: Preserve types — booleans and numbers must be JSON booleans/numbers, not strings.
- **No trailing commas**: Ensure no trailing commas are present; validate with a strict JSON parser.
- **Encoding**: Save JSON files as UTF-8 without BOM.
- **Trailing newline**: Ensure a single trailing newline at EOF.
- **Do not edit generated or lock files**: Avoid manual edits to machine-generated files (lockfiles, package manager caches). If you must, document why and test the change.
- **Sorting of Keys**: For JSON files, sort keys alphabetically within objects when creating new files or when the project convention expects sorted keys (e.g., machine-generated configs). For human-facing manifests (like `package.json`), prefer semantic grouping — but when in doubt, sort keys alphabetically to improve diff stability. Document any deviation in the PR.

## Exception Handling and Human Review

- **Include a note in the summary for Human Review**: If a change would violate any of these directives (other than cases where validation couldn't be performed due to an inaccessible schema), the agent must use the method that conforms closest to the directives and include a note in the summary for human review. If schema validation cannot be performed, annotate the summary with that fact rather than blocking the change.
