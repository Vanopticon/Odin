# TypeScript TSX Companion

Purpose: This companion file covers the `.tsx` extension. All rules are the same as `Typescript.instructions.md` (which targets `*.ts`). When making changes to `.tsx` files, follow the directives in `Typescript.instructions.md`.

## Exception Handling & Human Review

- **Tag for Human Review**: If changes would violate these directives, the agent must use the method that conforms closest to the directives and include a note in the summary for human review.
